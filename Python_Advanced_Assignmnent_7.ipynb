What is the purpose of the try statement?**\n","\n","Ans: try statement is used for exception handling in python. it consists of a block of risky statements which might cause an exception during runtime. if code within try block raises exception, then the exception will be reverted to the corresponding except block if multiple except blocks are present, else it willbe reverted to the default except block. In short try and except in union avoid programs from crashing during runtime due to exceptions."],"metadata":{"id":"tn1jQvRFo35f"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["try:\n","    print(10/0)\n","except ZeroDivisionError:\n","    print('Division by Zero is Not Possible')"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Gu7wCfFNo8W9","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1683470169752,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":7,"user":{"displayName":"Shubham Kumar","userId":"04312815547410837160"}},"outputId":"45e4394c-6c82-43ff-d791-c4f77a70b4a2"},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Division by Zero is Not Possible\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Q2.

What does the assert statement do, and what other statement is it like?**\n","\n","Ans: There are few assertions that programmer always want to be true to avoid code failure.
